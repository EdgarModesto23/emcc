# EMCC (Edgar Modesto C Compiler)

This is my own C compiler written in rust following the [Writing a C compiler](https://nostarch.com/writing-c-compiler) book by Nora Sandler. I'm using the book's test suite to validate the correctness of the compiler.

I'm using gcc's preprocessor and linker for producing the final binary, at least for now.
